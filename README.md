This is a project I've been working on in my spare time in order to help myself and others write more "pythonic" code. It does require at least a basic knowledge of python or at least programming concepts in general.

This is a work in progress. Please reach out if you have suggestions to improve this project or even to colab. Even if I'm unfamiliar, I'm always interested in learning new features/modules/tips that I can then teach to others. I hope you find this project helpful in learning the more niche topics of python as it has been for me! üòÅ
